# completions = [r"<think>To convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we use the following formulas:1. The radial distance ( r ) is given by the formula ( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ), where ( x ) and ( y ) are the rectangular coordinates.2. The angle ( \theta ) is given by the formula ( \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{y}{x} \right) ), but we must ensure that the angle is in the correct quadrant.For the point ( (0, 3) ), the coordinates are ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 3 ).* First, calculate ( r ):[r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3.]* Now, we need to find ( \theta ). Since ( x = 0 ), the point lies on the ( y )-axis. The angle corresponding to a point on the positive ( y )-axis is ( \frac{\pi}{2} ) radians.Thus, the polar coordinates of the point ( (0, 3) ) are ( (r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2}) ). </think>The final answer is ( \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})} )."]
